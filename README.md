# task_manager_app

Test Project: Task Manager App
Overview:
Build a task manager app using Flutter that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. The
app should have a clean and intuitive user interface, robust state management, seamless
performance, local storage for persistent data, and comprehensive unit tests to ensure
functionality.

Key Features:

1. User Authentication: Implement user authentication using the https://dummyjson.com/docs/auth.
   Users should be able to log in securely with their Username and Password.
2. Task Management: Allow users to view, add, edit, and delete tasks.
   Use https://dummyjson.com/docs/todos for managing task data.
3. Pagination: Implement pagination for fetching a large number of tasks efficiently. Utilize
   the https://dummyjson.com/todos?limit=10&skip=10 endpoint for pagination as mentioned in the docs
   in the previous point.
4. State Management: Implement state management using one of the following patterns:
   Provider, Bloc, or Redux. Ensure that state is managed efficiently and updated across
   the app as needed.
5. Local Storage: Persist tasks locally using Flutter's shared preferences or SQLite
   database. Ensure that tasks remain accessible even when the app is closed and
   reopened.
6. Unit Tests: Write comprehensive unit tests to cover critical functionalities such as task
   CRUD operations, input validation, state management, and network requests. Use mock
   responses for testing against reqres.in endpoints.
